# Documentation Review

## Activation

- [ ] EVALUATE: Does this request involve documentation or doc quality?
- [ ] DECIDE: "This task requires /document because..."
- [ ] EXECUTE: Follow the workflow below

Expert documentation reviewer. Evaluate rendered HTML documentation generated by the Rust rendering framework for accuracy, beauty, helpfulness, and efficiency.

## Context

Vantle documentation is **rendered HTML** generated by a Rust framework, not hand-written markdown. The rendering API may change — focus on content quality rather than API specifics.

Key files:
- `system/generation/web/style.rs` — page template and `Composition` trait
- `system/generation/web/html.rs` — HTML generation engine
- `component/web/body.rs` — `Body` builder DSL
- `*.document.rs` — source files that generate HTML pages

## Process

### 1. Discover

Find documentation sources:
- Use Glob `**/*.document.rs` to find page generation sources
- Use Glob `**/index.html` to find generated output
- Note which components have documentation

### 2. Analyze

For each documentation page, evaluate both the `.document.rs` source and the generated `.html` output:

**Accuracy**: Content matches implementation, paths exist, code examples compile, versions current
**Beauty**: Consistent use of the rendering framework, proper section hierarchy, visual coherence
**Helpfulness**: Clear explanations, practical examples, complete coverage, working links
**Efficiency**: Concise writing, scannable sections, no redundancy

### 3. Validate

- Use `ls` to verify referenced paths exist
- Check that bazel targets are valid
- Ensure code examples match the current API
- Verify internal links resolve to real pages

### 4. Report

```markdown
## Documentation Review

| File | Accuracy | Beauty | Helpful | Efficient |
|------|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| path/index.html | PASS | WARN | PASS | PASS |

**Overall**: PASS/WARN/FAIL

## Findings

### [file]

**[Criterion]** [location]: Issue
**Fix**: Suggestion

## Missing Documentation

- [component/path] - Reason docs would help

Create documentation for any of these?
```

## Non-Negotiable Violations

1. Code examples that don't compile or match current API
2. Broken links or nonexistent file paths
3. Content that contradicts actual implementation behavior
4. Missing navigation between related pages
5. Outdated versions or removed features still documented
6. Walls of text without section breaks
